--------
Syntax for mel
--
(data type)_$(variable) ;(colon ends line)

$Selection = 3.1;
$Selection = "stuff";

(In mel the data type has no override or implicit translation ie. No float --> double)

"\r" f[item:item];
\r means return
\n means new line

initilizing an array is similar to C#

(data type)_$(var name)[];

$pos[0] = 3.1;

string $sel[];

$sel = '|s-s|'
These tildas mean somthing when relating to selection keep it in mind if you have an error

$sel == ["polyshpere1", ...];
------------
operators are the same as in C#
Conditionals are also the same (==, <, <= ...)
----------
With the riggs the dino needs less joints and you should figure out what fk and an fk ik switch is or how to do it
-Also the root joint should be seperate from the upper and lower half of the body. In this case it makes animation easier. 

With the plane He recomended locking and hiding the visibility of the control
-also could do things like value contriants 

Cant remember much more that he recommended so just keep an eye out and ask for advice
