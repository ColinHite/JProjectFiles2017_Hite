--------
Syntax for mel
--
(data type)_$(variable) ;(colon ends line)

$Selection = 3.1;
$Selection = "stuff";

(In mel the data type has no override or implicit translation ie. No float --> double)

"\r" f[item:item];
\r means return
\n means new line

initilizing an array is similar to C#

(data type)_$(var name)[];

$pos[0] = 3.1;

string $sel[];

$sel = '|s-s|'
These tildas mean somthing when relating to selection keep it in mind if you have an error

$sel == ["polyshpere1", ...];
------------
operators are the same as in C#
Conditionals are also the same (==, <, <= ...)
